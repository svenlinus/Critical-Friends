    <h1 class="title">Rationale</h1>
    <p>
        Biases and inequitable practices are systemic challenges. We have years of experience in supporting
organizations with mitigating these issues. Eliminating biases and creating equity dramatically
expands students of colorâ€™s ability to
grow personally, learn, build generational wealth and experience all the rights of our society.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">The Why</h1>
    <p>
        Leaders are actively engaged in doing equity work, contracting with organizations such as Race Works, Pacific Equity Group and Facing History Facing Ourselves. While this is critical work and needs to continue, CEO/Leaders also need ongoing support moving from theory to action. After workshops,  they are responsible for carrying the throughline with their staff. This requires thoughtful planning, debriefing, assessing data and an accountability partner over time. CEO/Leaders may be faced with multiple competing priorities making their job nearly impossible. For example, the recent pandemic has further eaten away at school administrator time for day to day responsibilities and has exacerbated the inequitable outcomes between students groups.    </p>
